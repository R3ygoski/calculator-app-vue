### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size

- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS extension
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS pre-processor
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) - State Manager

### What I learned

This was my first project using a state manager like Pinia. I found it extremely interesting how we can use it to avoid prop drilling. I intend to use it more often, as it proved to be an easy-to-use tool of great importance in the development of large applications.

### Continued development

One of the areas I intend to focus on and improve is working with Pinia, as mastering state managers is beneficial.
